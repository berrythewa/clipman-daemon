# Clipman

A secure, cross-platform clipboard manager and sync suite with integrated secret vault and P2P file sharing. Built for power users, developers, and privacy-conscious individuals who need a unified solution for managing sensitive data across devices.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.23 or later
- X11 development libraries (for Linux)
- Git

### Installation

#### Local Installation (No Root Required)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/berrythewa/clipman-daemon.git
cd clipman-daemon

# Build and install locally
make install-local
```

#### System-wide Installation
```bash
# Build and install system-wide
sudo make install
```

#### Using Go Install
```bash
go install github.com/berrythewa/clipman-daemon/cmd/clipman@latest
go install github.com/berrythewa/clipman-daemon/cmd/clipmand@latest
```

### Running the Daemon

#### Manual Start
```bash
# Start in foreground
clipman

# Start in background
clipman --detach

# Check status
clipman daemon status

# Stop the daemon
clipman daemon stop
```

#### Systemd Service (Linux)
```bash
# Install systemd service
sudo cp scripts/clipman.service /etc/systemd/system/clipman@$USER.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable clipman@$USER
sudo systemctl start clipman@$USER
```

### Uninstallation

#### System-wide Uninstallation
```bash
# Uninstall system-wide
sudo make uninstall
```

#### Local Uninstallation
```bash
# Remove local installation
rm -f ~/.local/bin/clipman
rm -f ~/.local/bin/clipmand

# Remove data and configuration (optional)
rm -rf ~/.clipman
rm -rf ~/.config/clipman
```

#### Service Removal
```bash
# Remove systemd service
sudo systemctl stop clipman@$USER
sudo systemctl disable clipman@$USER
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/clipman@$USER.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

The uninstaller will:
1. Remove the binary files
2. Stop and remove any installed services
3. Optionally remove all data and configuration
4. Clean up any remaining files
